Determine the base pay rate for employees. This can be an hourly rate, a monthly salary, or an annual salary.
Multiply the base pay rate by the number of hours worked to calculate the salary for hourly employees.
For salaried employees, the salary is typically fixed regardless of hours worked, so no additional calculation is necessary.


Basic Salary Calculation with Overtime:
Define the standard work hours for employees (e.g., 40 hours per week).
Determine the overtime rate, which is typically 1.5 times the regular hourly rate.
Calculate the regular pay for hours worked within the standard work hours.
Calculate the overtime pay for hours worked beyond the standard work hours using the overtime rate.


Salary Calculation with Deductions:
Identify deductions that need to be subtracted from the gross salary. This may include taxes, insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and any other deductions required by law or company policy.
Subtract the total deductions from the gross salary to calculate the net salary.
